  <h1>brain브레인</h1> <strong>The brain</strong>  is an <u>organ</u> that serves as the center of
  the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertevrate
  animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close
  to the sensory organs for senses such as vision.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">The brain
  is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.</p>

   In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 10-20 billion neurons,
  and the estimatedd number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55-70
  billion neurons.<br><br> Each neuron is connected by synapes to several
  thousand other neurons. Thses neurons communicate with one another
  by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry
  trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts
  of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
